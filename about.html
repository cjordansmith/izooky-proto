						<p>iZooky is about Help and Professional Advice. Finding it. Getting it. Giving it. And making it easy and affordable to do so. Why? When we founded the company, we knew we were onto a great idea. Not just because the business model worked, but also because we found that like us people who needed help didn’t always get it. <br><br>On the one hand, the reasons why were not very good: <br>1) No time<br>2) Not enough money<br>3) People just don’t know where to turn for help and advice.<br>4) Fear of being judged by friends and family or asking a stupid question<br><br>On the other hand, we learned that thousands of professionals across this nation are working in jobs that have little or nothing to do with their qualifications. Law school graduates working as servers, rocket scientists working as chauffer’s and MBAs working as valets. It doesn't seem right that in our communities, where we have such a need for help and, also have the ability to give it, there is no good way to connect the two. It also doesn’t seem fair that in order to get great advice you have to pay hundreds of “minimum” fee dollars, even if you don’t use the whole appointment block (usually an hour). We feel very strongly that by making these connections possible, removing the “issues” that stop people from both getting and giving help, we can make a difference in hundreds of thousands of lives.<br><br>We therefore created iZooky. A web and mobile application that makes it easy to find, select, meet with and immediately pay for qualified expert advice from the privacy and comfort of your home or office.  For experts and Professionals, iZooky is a way to expand reach, keep in touch with their existing clients and streamline their administrative processes easily. We’re excited to work on a project that means we can first do good in our communities, while also being profitable.</p>

						<h3 class="text-dblue text-center">iZooky Philosophy</h3>
						<p>The Circle with a dot in the center is known as a circumpunct.  It’s an ancient symbol that holds cultural, directional, religious, mystical and scientific significance.  The Egyptians and Chinese use it as a symbol of the sun, while the Kabbalah refers to it as the ‘Keter’, and it forms to the topmost of the Tree of life – literally a ‘crown’.  In Astronomy it is the symbol of ‘Solar Mass’, or a symbol used to represent the sun while the Australian aborigines use a similar symbol to denote a watering hole.</p>
						<p>We felt this multifaceted aspect of the circumpunct reflected our mission and goal; meaningful information to people everywhere; a resource for both people who seek answers and give them.</p>
						<p>Most serendipitously, the circumpunct is also the symbol of the ‘Sprit’ for the Ojibwe (Chippewa) group of Native Americans.  Fittingly, stories within the Anishinaabe traditional beliefs are called “Aadizookaan”, while the manifestation of such stories were referred to as Aadizookaanag essentially muses or sources of inspiration.  So, quite by chance, our name and our symbol are magically related (with a bit of imagination!)</p>
						<p>We hope that everyone who visits iZooky will receive exceptional advice that is useful, inspirational, and helpful while always being convenient and affordable.</p>

						<h4>Talyn Good</h4>
						<p>Talyn has worked in the non-profit sector for over 20 years and during this time strived to educate, advocate and defend the rights of under-privileged people both in Kansas City and around the world.   Seven years ago, she co-founded and helped to build Heshima Kenya, a not for profit that protected the rights of unaccompanied refugee minors by providing them with a holistic set of health, education and advocacy services.</p>
						<p>For Talyn, iZooky is an opportunity to continue to do good for the world by helping them connect with the help they need.  Her passion lies in the fact that iZooky will deliver social benefits by being an affordable and accessible resource for qualified professional help in all areas from counseling &amp; psychiatric care to legal advocacy and advice.</p>
