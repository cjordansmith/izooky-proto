Law school graduates working as servers, rocket scientists working as chauffer’s and MBAs working as valets. It doesn't seem right that in our communities, where we have such a need for help and, also have the ability to give it, there is no good way to connect the two. It also doesn’t seem fair that in order to get great advice you have to pay hundreds of “minimum” fee dollars, even if you don’t use the whole appointment block (usually an hour). We feel very strongly that by making these connections possible, removing the “issues” that stop people from both getting and giving help, we can make a difference in hundreds of thousands of lives.</p>

						<p>iZooky is about Help and Professional Advice. Finding it. Getting it. Giving it. And making it easy and affordable to do so. Why? When we founded the company, we knew we were onto a great idea. Not just because the business model worked, but also because we found that like us people who needed help didn’t always get it.</p>

						<p>On the one hand, the reasons why were not very good:
							<ol class="help-ins-li">
